PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

This project demonstrates the complete lifecycle of a Data Science solution, starting from data collection and preprocessing to model building and deployment using Flask or FastAPI. The objective is to build a predictive system that can be accessed through a web interface or API, making the model usable in real-world applications.

The first stage is data collection. Data can be gathered from public datasets such as Kaggle, government portals, or APIs. Tools like Python, Pandas, and NumPy are used to load and manage the dataset. After collecting the data, the next step is data preprocessing, which includes handling missing values, removing duplicates, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling, and data transformation. Libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn are used for cleaning and preparing the data. Data visualization is performed using Matplotlib and Seaborn to understand patterns, correlations, and outliers.

Once the data is ready, the model building phase begins. The dataset is split into training and testing sets using Scikit-learn. Depending on the problem (classification, regression, or clustering), suitable algorithms such as Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, or Support Vector Machines (SVM) are implemented. Model performance is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, or mean squared error.

After selecting the best-performing model, it is saved using Joblib or Pickle. The next phase is model deployment, where the trained model is integrated into a web application using Flask or FastAPI. Flask/FastAPI is used to create REST APIs that accept user input, process it, and return predictions. A simple frontend can be developed using HTML, CSS, and optionally JavaScript to allow users to interact with the model.

For development and testing, tools such as Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, and Postman (for API testing) are used. Version control is managed using Git and GitHub. The project can also be deployed on cloud platforms like Heroku, Render, or AWS for public access.

Overall, this project covers the end-to-end Data Science pipeline, demonstrating practical skills in data analysis, machine learning, and web deployment, making it suitable for real-world applications and portfolio development.
